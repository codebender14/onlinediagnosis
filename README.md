# Online Diagnosis
This is an iOS Application. During the pandemic, many peoples have suffered due to the disease "CORONA" by lacking attention and less support for the treatment remotely. Our idea is bring forth the services and health care to the people in need of medical assistance. Our application makes the process more easy and user-friendly to find a doctor near by. We even extend our services by providing features such as Virtual Chats & Video Calls and Paperless Prescriptions.
